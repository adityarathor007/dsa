OOPs: ia a programming style where things revolve around object that enhances the readability
Object: 
    - is an entity that has 2 things:
        - State/Properties
        - Behaviour
    - is an instance of class
    - size of the object is the space occupied by the properties
        - For object of empty class the space occupied will be 1 byte just for identification/keep track of it
    - Object can be created via static or dynamic allocation


Class: user defined datatype (template)

Access Modifier: from where can you access a property and behaviour what is it scope
    - Public: 
    - Private: (By default) these can be accessed within class
    - Protected: 


To access the private properties outside the class we make use of getter/setter

padding and greedy alignment

Constructor: 
    - invoked during object creation and has no return type 
    - by default it is created and invoked when the object is created  
    - this default constructor gets removed if we create our own  (i.e if we just create a constructors without parameters)
    - there can 2 different constructor that takes different parameters
    - When we create a class it generates copy constructor be default which allows us to copy an objects properties values 
    - We can create our own copy constructor but make sure while writing the function we pass '&' else it will a self infinite loop as a copy constructor gets called if we create a copy and when we pass by value it creates a copy so we are passing an argumment to an function which gets invoked when the object is created
    - Default copy constructor does shallow copy    `   


'this' stores the address of the current object
